House
======
An experimental OS written in Haskell, developed as part of Programmatica
project at Portland State University.

This repository is a yet another fork of original code, available from project
home page:

http://programatica.cs.pdx.edu/House/

I just needed to make some modification, therefore pulled it on Github

# Dependencies
Gmake -- Use GNU Make, even if you are not on Linux
